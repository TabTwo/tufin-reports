# Reports and KPIs for tufin
Extract lots of numbers from the tufin suite and give management some nice graphs.

The idea is to use prometheus and/or grafana to make this happen.

- [ ] number of devices
- [ ] number of rules
- [ ] number of workflows
- [ ] number of users
- [ ] number of requests
- [ ] number of Syslogentries per second
